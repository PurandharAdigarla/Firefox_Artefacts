Enter Autofill, the most popular autofill extension: now you can autofill form fields lightning fast without any user interaction, and so much more! If you know some JavaScript, then you can program Autofill to do a lot of cool stuff like filling out a multi-page form, submitting a form after autofilling it, or even reloading a product page every 10 seconds until the product is in stock and completing the checkout.\n\nGive Autofill a try today to increase your productivity and decrease your risk of getting Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) or Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS).\n\nFEATURES\n\n    Set and forget — fill out forms in ZERO clicks! There's also a manual mode.\n    Autofill everything — works on all input types (checkbox, color, date, email, hidden, number, password, radio, range, search, text, time), textarea fields, select fields, contentEditable fields, and rich text editors (WYSIWYG).\n    Ultimate power — auto-click buttons and links, auto-submit forms, and any automation you can dream up using JavaScript or jQuery.\n    Form fields wizard — use the infobar to automatically generate autofill rules for you without having to look at the HTML code.\n    Easy to manage — create, sort, and duplicate profiles to better organize your autofill rules. You can also use search to quickly find a rule.\n    Quick access — add autofill rules using the toolbar icon or right-click context menu. Assign profile hotkeys or use a global hotkey to execute rules from the infobar.\n    Peace of mind — automatically save text fields in case the browser crashes.\n    Regular Expressions — use powerful text matching patterns to identify fields to autofill.\n    Text clips — insert boilerplate text snippets in text fields.\n    Variables — use special variables to output boilerplate text, JavaScript return value, other rule names/values, random/sequential words from a list, incrementing/decrementing numbers, and random data.\n    Site filters — restrict autofilling on a per-site or per-page basis (match by URL or document title).\n    Exceptions — specify pages or entire websites to exclude from Autofill.\n    Import/Export — back up your autofill rules and settings. Restore your data from a local or remote file. You can also share data across different browsers by installing Autofill in each browser.\n    Keyboard shortcuts — navigate and reorder rules using the keyboard.\n    Localized — French, Portuguese, and Simplified Chinese are supported. Translate Autofill into your local language if it's not listed.\n\n\nPRIVACY & SECURITY\n\nAutofill does not track your browsing history in any way, nor does it transmit any data over the internet. All data remains on your local hard disk drive at all times. However, the data saved by this extension is NOT encrypted, so any data you save remains in the clear, although it will remain on your hard drive and only someone who knows where to look and has physical access to your hard drive would be able to access it. Your activities are also not monitored by Google Analytics or equivalent tracking tags.\n\nPERMISSIONS\n\nThe following permissions are required by this extension:\n\n    host (http://*/*, https://*/*, file://*/*) — allow Autofill's content script to operate on all non-secure pages, secure pages, and local files. Technically, Autofill has to be able to read data (to detect form fields) and change data (to fill out the form for you) on the web pages that you visit. Note that Autofill does not and will never track your browsing history, nor does it transmit any data back to a remote server. Your data remains on your local hard drive at all times.\n    contextMenus — add Autofill to the right-click context menu.\n    storage — store rules and settings on your hard drive.\n    unlimitedStorage — allow unlimited storage. Without this permission you would only be able to store 5 MB of data.","weeklyDownloads":990,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"tohodo.com","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/5550677/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266009.png?modified=1643515023","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266009.jpg?modified=1643515023","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266010.png?modified=1643515023","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266010.jpg?modified=1643515023","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266011.png?modified=1643515023","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266011.jpg?modified=1643515023","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266012.png?modified=1643515023","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266012.jpg?modified=1643515023","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266013.png?modified=1643515023","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266013.jpg?modified=1643515023","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333}],"contributionURL":"https://paypal.me/10basetom?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":3.9943,"reviewCount":81,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/autofill-quantum/reviews/","updateDate":1677839601000},{"id":"adguardadblocker@adguard.com","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/520/520576-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/520/520576-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/520/520576-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"AdGuard AdBlocker","version":"4.1.53","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4046830/adguard_adblocker-4.1.53.xpi","homepageURL":"http://adguard.com/","supportURL":"https://adguard.com/","description":"Unmatched adblock extension against advertising and pop-ups.

Speeds up page loading and saves bandwidth, thanks to the missing ads and pop up windows;\n3. Blocks many spyware, adware, and dialer installers;\n4. Protects your privacy by blocking common third-party tracking systems;\n5. Protects you from malware and phishing.\n\nHow can AdGuard ad blocker protect your privacy?\n\nJust enable Tracking Protection filter in AdGuard settings.

AdGuard has one of the largest tracker filters containing more than 5,000 rules.\n\nHow to remove social media with AdGuard?\n\nTired of all the «Like» buttons and similar widgets infesting all of your frequented web pages? Just enable AdGuard \"Social media filter\" and forget about them.\n\nHow can AdGuard ad blocker protect you from online threats?\n\nAt the moment we’ve got more than 2,000,000 harmful websites on record.

Naive ad blocking would simply block ad servers, and leave broken elements and first-party ads on the pages. AdGuard applies special cosmetic rules to make pages look clean and tidy.\n    Access browser activity during navigation: this permission is necessary to keep track of navigation events in order to apply rules when the time is right.\n\n\n==============================\n\nRelease notes:\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardBrowserExtension/releases\n\n==============================\n\nFree and Open Source:\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardBrowserExtension\n\n==============================\n\nFound a bug?
