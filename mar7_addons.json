Press one to search for the selected text using that engine! Google, YouTube, Maps, Amazon... you name it.\n\nDo you prefer using the right-click context menu? Your choice! :) And you can always disable this or the popup in the options menu (see below).\n\nPersonalization\n\nSSS is very configurable. Open the \"Extensions\" menu on Firefox, find \"Swift Selection Search\" in the list, click the three dots on the corner, and finally click \"Options\" to explore all the settings.\n\nYou can add new search engines for the popup and context search, change the appearance of the icons, what happens when you click them, when/where the popup appears, whether to auto-copy text on selection, etc. Remember to follow the short instructions at the top!\n\nABOUT PERMISSIONS:\n\nAmong other arguably less intrusive permissions, SSS also requires permission to \"Access your data for all websites\". This is simply to fix a problem that caused the popup to not work in pages that use frames. SSS does not care about what sites you use and does not send your data anywhere. (Well, if you ask it, it can backup settings to Firefox Sync!)\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nSSS is an open source project made by Daniel Lobo with the collaboration of awesome people on GitHub. :)","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/190/190418.png?modified=1622132312","width":600,"height":432,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/190/190418.jpg?modified=1622132312","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":384,"caption":"Popup with your search engines.

Enter Autofill, the most popular autofill extension: now you can autofill form fields lightning fast without any user interaction, and so much more! If you know some JavaScript, then you can program Autofill to do a lot of cool stuff like filling out a multi-page form, submitting a form after autofilling it, or even reloading a product page every 10 seconds until the product is in stock and completing the checkout.\n\nGive Autofill a try today to increase your productivity and decrease your risk of getting Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) or Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS).\n\nFEATURES\n\n    Set and forget — fill out forms in ZERO clicks! There's also a manual mode.\n    Autofill everything — works on all input types (checkbox, color, date, email, hidden, number, password, radio, range, search, text, time), textarea fields, select fields, contentEditable fields, and rich text editors (WYSIWYG).\n    Ultimate power — auto-click buttons and links, auto-submit forms, and any automation you can dream up using JavaScript or jQuery.\n    Form fields wizard — use the infobar to automatically generate autofill rules for you without having to look at the HTML code.\n    Easy to manage — create, sort, and duplicate profiles to better organize your autofill rules. You can also use search to quickly find a rule.\n    Quick access — add autofill rules using the toolbar icon or right-click context menu. Assign profile hotkeys or use a global hotkey to execute rules from the infobar.\n    Peace of mind — automatically save text fields in case the browser crashes.\n    Regular Expressions — use powerful text matching patterns to identify fields to autofill.\n    Text clips — insert boilerplate text snippets in text fields.\n    Variables — use special variables to output boilerplate text, JavaScript return value, other rule names/values, random/sequential words from a list, incrementing/decrementing numbers, and random data.\n    Site filters — restrict autofilling on a per-site or per-page basis (match by URL or document title).\n    Exceptions — specify pages or entire websites to exclude from Autofill.\n    Import/Export — back up your autofill rules and settings. Restore your data from a local or remote file. You can also share data across different browsers by installing Autofill in each browser.\n    Keyboard shortcuts — navigate and reorder rules using the keyboard.\n    Localized — French, Portuguese, and Simplified Chinese are supported. Translate Autofill into your local language if it's not listed.\n\n\nPRIVACY & SECURITY\n\nAutofill does not track your browsing history in any way, nor does it transmit any data over the internet. All data remains on your local hard disk drive at all times. However, the data saved by this extension is NOT encrypted, so any data you save remains in the clear, although it will remain on your hard drive and only someone who knows where to look and has physical access to your hard drive would be able to access it. Your activities are also not monitored by Google Analytics or equivalent tracking tags.\n\nPERMISSIONS\n\nThe following permissions are required by this extension:\n\n    host (http://*/*, https://*/*, file://*/*) — allow Autofill's content script to operate on all non-secure pages, secure pages, and local files. Technically, Autofill has to be able to read data (to detect form fields) and change data (to fill out the form for you) on the web pages that you visit. Note that Autofill does not and will never track your browsing history, nor does it transmit any data back to a remote server. Your data remains on your local hard drive at all times.\n    contextMenus — add Autofill to the right-click context menu.\n    storage — store rules and settings on your hard drive.\n    unlimitedStorage — allow unlimited storage. Without this permission you would only be able to store 5 MB of data.","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266009.png?modified=1643515023","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266009.jpg?modified=1643515023","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266010.png?modified=1643515023","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266010.jpg?modified=1643515023","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266011.png?modified=1643515023","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266011.jpg?modified=1643515023","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266012.png?modified=1643515023","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266012.jpg?modified=1643515023","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266013.png?modified=1643515023","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266013.jpg?modified=1643515023","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333}],"homepageURL":"https://www.tohodo.com/autofill/help.html","supportURL":"https://groups.google.com/g/chrome-autofill","contributionURL":"https://paypal.me/10basetom?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":3.9943,"reviewCount":81,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/autofill-quantum/reviews/","weeklyDownloads":917,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4083863/autofill_quantum-11.3.1.xpi","updateDate":1678880168000},{"id":"firefox@ghostery.com","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/9/9609-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/9/9609-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/9/9609-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"Ghostery – Privacy Ad Blocker","version":"8.9.12","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4084996/ghostery-8.9.12.xpi","homepageURL":"http://www.ghostery.com/","supportURL":"https://www.ghostery.com/support/","description":"Ghostery is a powerful privacy extension.
